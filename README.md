Beer price tool for Xero
========================

Milton Brewery changed from using an ancient (only runs on Windows
versions up to XP) copy of the "Mind Your Own Business" accounting
program to Xero in April 2016.

The main sticking point is that Milton's price structure isn't
directly supported by Xero: Milton set their prices in bands, whereas
Xero only supports a percentage discount per customer.

Milton didn't want to change their price structure when changing their
accounting system, so I wrote this front-end for invoice entry that
supports their pricing scheme.

This code is unlikely to be useful to anyone else as-is!
